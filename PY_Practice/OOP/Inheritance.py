#Inheritance is the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes

# 3 types of access modifiers --- change which classes have access
# to other classes, methods, or attributes

# public, private, protected

# public members --- can be accessed from anywhere in the program

# private memebers --- can only accessed from within the same class that the member is defined

# protected memebers --- can be accessed within the class it is defined,
# as well as any subclasses of that class
